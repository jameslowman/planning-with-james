# Epic Learnings: {{EPIC_NAME}}

**Read this file before starting any sub-plan.** It contains accumulated context
from all completed sub-plans. This is how you understand months of work in minutes.

## Architecture Decisions (Locked In)

(Decisions that have been made and cannot be revisited. Include rationale.)

## Discoveries That Changed the Plan

(Things we learned that altered downstream sub-plans)

## Assumptions Proved Wrong

(Things we assumed that turned out to be false)

## Technical Debt Introduced (Deliberate)

(Shortcuts taken deliberately, with justification and cleanup plan)

## Patterns Established

(Patterns that downstream sub-plans should follow for consistency)

## Risks: Materialized vs Avoided

| Risk | Predicted | Actual | Notes |
|------|-----------|--------|-------|
