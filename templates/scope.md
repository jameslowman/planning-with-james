# Scope

## In-Scope Modules

Modules that will likely need changes:

| Module | Path | Why Included | Confidence |
|--------|------|--------------|------------|
| | | | High/Medium/Low |

## Out-of-Scope

Modules we're explicitly NOT touching:

| Module | Why Excluded |
|--------|--------------|
| | |

## Blast Radius Assessment

**Direct Impact**: (modules we'll definitely change)

**Potential Impact**: (modules that might be affected by our changes)

**Risk Level**: (Low/Medium/High)

**Rationale**: (why this risk level)

## Known Unknowns

Things we need to discover:

- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ]

## Discovery Plan

Based on scope, we'll explore these areas:

| Area | Modules | Focus | Priority |
|------|---------|-------|----------|
| | | | High/Medium/Low |

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
(Other parts of the system that must work correctly)

-

### External Dependencies
(Third-party services, APIs, libraries)

-

### Prerequisite Work
(Things that must be done before this work)

-

## Constraints

(Technical, business, or time constraints that affect scope)

-

## Assumptions

(Things we're assuming to be true)
